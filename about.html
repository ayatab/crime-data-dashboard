      This smart dashboard displays Seattle crime locations on a map as well as
      presents visualizations of statistics concerning that same data. The goal
      of this project is to provide easily accessible and up to date maps and
      statistics for purposes related to travel and potential living situations.
      It could also be informative to law enforcers as to what areas may need
      stricter patrolling.

      Disclaimer: The crime data used in this project is only of finalized
      crime reports, not necessarily all crimes that have occurred. It is also
      important to note that any entry missing a latitude or longitude coordinate
      was filtered out of the data.
